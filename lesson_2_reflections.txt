What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

'Cos that's how you do version control with ur sheeeeiiit!!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I honestly have no idea. I'm here to learn this stuff not tell you why it exists.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Honestly I'm barely registering the why's at the moment. I'm sure I'll figure it out with further use but these explanations are confusering my tiny brain.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

can keep separate changes separate. I'm sure there's research that says writing things down helps memory retention but I don't think this is exactly what the researchers had in mind.
